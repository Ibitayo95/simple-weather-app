Simple app that consumes the open weather API to display weather data to the user. Toggle for switching between celsius and farenheit. 

1. Front end - react JS framework using material UI components alongside some custom components I've built. Also utilised the built in fetch API in order to gather the data from my back end.

2. Back end - express js/node js. not very complex - one endpoint that is responsible for gathering weather data

3. Moved application from local machine to 'production environment' by deploying the app using Heroku.
